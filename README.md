# Planner

Plan the planner: 

    Visual: 
        - 3 columns
            -1st col: times.
            -2nd col: scheduled data.
            -3rd col: save icon?? uh... no. 

    

    functionality: 
        -web app interacts with browser's clock. 
        -local storage: data needs to stay after refresh. 
        - colors to determine either importance or duration of event?
        - How to determine current time?
        - once event occurs, How should the app behave? Alert function? 



    concept: 
        - look into google calander API
        - Calander App on my phone: 
            - shows white bar reflecting on the minute of the clock without exact time
            - hour markers are shown as cells within hour increments
            - date shows for the day, 3 days, week, or month. 
            - clicking on the month shows a calander with a dot that reflects on an event scheduled for the day. 
            - "+" icon shows for adding an event. 
                - clicking the "+" icon shows the menu
                option for "all day" event
